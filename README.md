# Sudoku-Solver
Solves *most* sudoku boards

To use the solver there are 2 options. 
1. Either you insert each number individually by inputing the coordinates and the number, eg. to put a 1 on row 1 collumn 1 you'd imput A 1 1.
2. Or you input the full board at once by inserting the board in the arguments, each number is separated by a space and empty cells must be a 0, the order is as follows on the image. Then you have the option to edit it in the same way you'd edit the board when you start from scratch. Typing End will stop the editing and will start the solver. eg. java Sudoku 5 3 0 6 0 0 0 9 8 0 7 0 1 9 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 8 0 0 4 0 0 7 0 0 0 6 0 8 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 9 0 8 0 2 8 0 0 0 5 0 7 9
